# LaTeX-on-HTTP demo

This demo show what you can do with the LaTeX-on-HTTP to edit PDF in the browser (the same API calls could be done in server-side code).

Play with it to see how the LaTeX-on-HTTP requests are generated. :)

You can fork it to adapt to your own needs: for example for automating your letter writting workflow; or for freelancer to create your proposals and invoices from plain-text data (like `yaml` or `json`).
